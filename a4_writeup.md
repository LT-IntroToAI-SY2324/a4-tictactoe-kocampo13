# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe? 
The most difficult part was the has_won function because I didn't realize I could use more than one if statement.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
It can go in two ways where it is either random with the bot placing it's move where it is empty or where the bot looks for what's around and tries to match the patterns of the opponent in order to block it.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
The computer can be told to look for certain patterns like if somewhere on the board has more than one "X" in a line or diagonal to place its next move there. There are many possibilies on the board so I'm not sure how to simplify it other than just listing every single possible win.
